Configuration management in between 2 ec2 instances is done. 
1 is Ansible server and other second is target server so you first use ssh to connect between these 2. 
This connection which should be established without a password also called password less authentication is established using " ssh-keygen " command in the cli. 
Now a public and private keys are generated, you can use public key to connect between servers and private key should not be exposed to anyone.
Also generate public and private keys in the other server as well using the same command
Now you use your public key and copy paste it into the other server authentication keys to connect. 
Now your all set to ssh into the other server (target server)
Now you can use  Ansible adhoc commands to  execute small shell scripting commands/ to execute group of commands you can write a yaml file which is also called playbooks/ you can either execute roles and tasks if the commands are complicated. 
You can upgrade servers/ talk with servers etc using Ansible.
